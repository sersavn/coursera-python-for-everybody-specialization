Retrieving GEOData

Download the code from http://www.py4e.com/code3/geodata.zip - then unzip the file and edit where.data to add an address nearby where you live - don't reveal your actual location. Then run the geoload.py to lookup all of the entries in where.data (including the new one) and produce the geodata.sqlite. Then run geodump.py to read the database and produce where.js. Then open where.html to visualize the map. Take screen shots as described below.
